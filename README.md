Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
There are 4 major requirements; a login, a way for users to track their weight, a way for users to identify a target weight, and an SMS notification option for reaching their target weight. This allows users to track their weight and determine if they are on track to reach their goal or not. Upon reaching their target weight they will receive a notification about their success.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
So there are two major activities used, a login activity and a recyclerview activity. These helped with the first 3 major requirements. The last requirement was done through a menu to manage. Additionally there were dialog boxes provided for the user to manipulate weights/dates and their SMS notification phone number. While it wasn't everything I wanted to target in the design, it achieved simplicity in telling the user what to input at what action. I believe in simplicity and minimalism when it comes to user interfaces, I think I kept with this philosophy in having a simple UI.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I ended up having to re-do several steps due to the UI design at first. In retrospect, working with a storyboard first with user personas would probably be the best approach. This would allow for me to define what I needed to achieve up-front and then design the back-end to support the UI. I think it mostly comes down to time constraints which prevented me from practicing that which I try very hard to do in my current professional environment.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I effectively tested once a feature was ready to be tested. I would run the emulator and try several inputs and different ways to see if I could get an unexpected output. This is important because it helps you find a baseline everytime you test. "This ran before, but it isn't now. What did I change and how did it impact the user experience?". I've always agreed with the mindset to code a little and then test to ensure you get what you expect.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
The UI development was absolutely the hardest part for me. I wanted to do so much to make the UI as easy as possible but found the level of effort to get there far greater than anticipated. So I tried to find simple solutions that achieve a similar outcome. I absolutely have a greater respect for UI devs now than when I first started this program.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I would argue that the UX in particular I was probably the most experienced. Two things impact my insight here, one I have always been drawn to design since I took a lot of architecture and mechanical design courses earlier in my life. Second, I work as a product manager now and I always have to push for easier and better user experiences. In no way am I going to say that the end-product of this project was it the best it could be, it just shows that my potential to build a UI is far behind my potential to design a UI.
